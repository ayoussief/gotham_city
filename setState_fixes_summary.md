# setState and Refresh Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **WalletScreen Stream Subscriptions**
- **Problem**: Stream listeners were not properly stored and disposed
- **Fix**: Added proper `StreamSubscription` variables and disposal in `dispose()`
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and cascading setState calls

### 2. **RefreshIndicator Excessive Calls**
- **Problem**: RefreshIndicator could trigger multiple simultaneous refreshes
- **Fix**: Added checks to prevent refresh when already loading or syncing
- **Impact**: Reduces unnecessary network calls and UI updates

### 3. **WalletSelector Dialog Interference**
- **Problem**: setState was being called while dialogs were open, causing them to rebuild
- **Fix**: Added `_dialogOpen` flag to prevent state updates during dialogs
- **Impact**: Seed phrase and name dialogs no longer flicker or rebuild

### 4. **Multiple Simultaneous Operations**
- **Problem**: Multiple `_loadWallet()` calls could run simultaneously
- **Fix**: Added loading state checks to prevent overlapping operations
- **Impact**: Prevents racing conditions and excessive API calls

### 5. **Transaction Screen Stream Management**
- **Problem**: Transaction stream listener wasn't properly managed
- **Fix**: Added proper subscription storage and disposal
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and unnecessary rebuilds

### 6. **SPV Status Screen Timing**
- **Problem**: Periodic refresh could overlap with manual refreshes
- **Fix**: Added `_isLoading` check to prevent overlapping refreshes
- **Impact**: Reduces system load and prevents UI stuttering

## Key Improvements:

### Stream Management
- All stream subscriptions are now properly stored and cancelled
- Added null checks and mounted checks before setState calls
- Prevented duplicate state updates with equality checks

### Loading State Management
- Added loading state guards to prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- RefreshIndicator respects existing loading states
- Dialog operations don't interfere with background state updates

### Memory Leak Prevention
- All StreamSubscriptions are properly disposed
- Proper null safety checks throughout
- Widget lifecycle management improved

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Test Tab Switching**: Verify tabs don't reload unnecessarily
2. **Test Dialog Stability**: Create wallets and ensure seed phrase dialog doesn't flicker
3. **Test Refresh Behavior**: Pull to refresh should work smoothly without conflicts
4. **Test Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks during extended use
5. **Test Stream Updates**: Verify wallet updates propagate correctly without excessive rebuilds

## File Changes Made:

- `lib/screens/wallet_screen.dart`: Fixed stream subscriptions and refresh logic
- `lib/screens/wallet_selector_screen.dart`: Added dialog state management
- `lib/screens/transactions_screen.dart`: Fixed stream subscription management
- `lib/bitcoin_node/screens/spv_status_screen.dart`: Fixed overlapping refresh prevention
- `lib/screens/main_screen.dart`: Used IndexedStack to prevent tab reloading

## Monitoring:

Watch the console logs for:
- "Wallet update received" messages (should be reasonable frequency)
- "Sync status update" messages (should not spam)
- No memory leak warnings
- Smooth UI transitions without stuttering
